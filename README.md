# About MBD

Glass Wave is a transparent theme for Discord. Glass Wave tries to stay as low as possible in using hardware resources while also delivering a smooth experience. 

I will try and provide Updates/Bug fixes as soon as possible when discord updates occur.

Glass Wave customisations: 

Use the bellow code in your custom css tab to customise the theme.

NOTE: For chat bubbles/mentioned use only solid colors without transparency.

:root{ --var-accent: Custom color ; 
--var-popout-color: Custom color ; 
--var-chat-bubbles-background: Custom color ;  
--var-chat-bubbles-edge-background: Custom color ;  
--var-chat-mentioned: Custom color ;
--var-background: url(Custom image);
};

Theme Presets:

Use the bellow @imports to apply pre-made customisation presets for Gass Wave.

@import url(https://elisniper.github.io/Glass-Wave/Addons/Presets/River.css);<br>
@import url(https://elisniper.github.io/Glass-Wave/Addons/Presets/Space.css);<br>
@import url(https://elisniper.github.io/Glass-Wave/Addons/Presets/Fantacy.css);<br>

# Installation

1. Download the theme [here](https://github.com/Elisniper/Glass-Wave)
2. Place the 'Glass Wave.theme.css' file into the BetterDiscord themes folder.
3. Enable the theme in the themes tab.

# Plugin Support
Glass Wave does not actively support all plugins and does not seek out theme fixes for every plugin out there. However, I try to stay as compatible as possible. (If an issue is found please create an issue on the GitHub Repo or reach out for some help in the BetterDiscord server.)
