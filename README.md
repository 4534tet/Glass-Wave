# About MBD

Glass Wave is a transparent theme for Discord. Glass Wave tries to stay as low as possible in using hardware resources while also delivering a smooth experience. 

I will try and provide Updates/Bug fixes as soon as possible when discord updates occur.

The background color can be customised using the below code. (Copy it into custom css and alter the RGBA values to change the color).

:root {--var-background: linear-gradient(138deg, rgba(162,247,220,1) 0%, rgba(18,145,187,1) 80%, rgba(35,108,179,1) 100%);;}

# Installation

1. Download the theme [here](https://github.com/Elisniper/Glass-Wave)
2. Place the 'Glass Wave.theme.css' file into the BetterDiscord themes folder.
3. Enable the theme in the themes tab.

# Plugin Support
Glass Wave does not actively support all plugins and does not seek out theme fixes for every plugin out there. However, I try to stay as compatible as possible. (If an issue is found please create an issue on the GitHub Repo or reach out for some help in the BetterDiscord server.)
